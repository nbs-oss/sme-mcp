          <p className="sub">
            A <strong>Subject Matter Expert</strong> profile is a structured persona — a discipline,
            an expertise level, a way of reasoning, known strengths and blind spots. Agents load one
            to think like a seasoned specialist instead of a generalist, and can consult several to
            pressure-test a decision from multiple angles.

          <h2>Why a library of experts is a game-changer</h2>
          <p className="sub">
            The hardest problems — strategic risk, emerging threats, long-range futures — are
            inherently multidisciplinary. No single analyst, and no single model, holds all the
            vantage points at once. A shared library of experts changes what's possible.
          </p>
          <div className="mk-grid">
            <div className="mk-card">
              <span className="ic">🧩</span>
              <h3>Multidisciplinary by construction</h3>
              <p>
                Real risks cut across intelligence, cyber, infrastructure, legal, and human factors.
                Convene a HUMINT officer, a cloud-security architect, and a strategic-warning analyst
                on the same question and the seams between disciplines — where threats hide — finally
                get covered.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="mk-card">
              <span className="ic">⚔️</span>
              <h3>Structured disagreement beats consensus</h3>
              <p>
                Each expert carries an explicit bias model, adversary lens, and evidence standard.
                Put them in tension and you surface the dissent a single averaged answer smooths over
                — the analytic red-teaming that catches the miss before it becomes the headline.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="mk-card">
              <span className="ic">🔭</span>
              <h3>Futures & warning need many lenses</h3>
              <p>
                Anticipating what hasn't happened yet is a portfolio of perspectives, not a point
                forecast. A library lets a futures effort assemble the right mix of specialists per
                scenario — and re-run it as the scenario shifts.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="mk-card">
              <span className="ic">🏛️</span>
              <h3>Expertise that compounds</h3>
              <p>
                Scarce senior judgment usually lives in a few heads and leaves when they do. Encoded
                as SMEs, it becomes durable institutional memory — versioned, quality-ranked, and
                reusable across every team and every agent, not re-learned each time.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="mk-card">
              <span className="ic">⚖️</span>
              <h3>Calibrated, not credulous</h3>
              <p>
                Each expert declares what it over- and under-weights, when it updates fast or slow,
                and where it must defer. That turns "ask the AI" into a defensible analytic process
                with known blind spots — the difference between an opinion and an assessment.
              </p>

              <h3>Scale scarce judgment on demand</h3>
              <p>
                A panel that once required scheduling five busy specialists now assembles in seconds,
                for every analyst and every scenario. Depth of expertise stops being the bottleneck.

              Anticipating what hasn't happened yet demands warning analysts, denial-and-deception

              own evidence bar and blind spots made explicit. The SME Library lets an all-source or
              futures effort convene exactly that panel on demand, hold it in structured
              disagreement, and re-run it as the picture changes. The judgment that used to live in a
              few overbooked heads becomes a resource every analyst can draw on.
